# Excel-Based-Option-Chain-Misspricing-Model
The provided Python code is designed for financial data retrieval, processing, and real-time updating of an Excel workbook. It focuses on BankNifty and India VIX, two key financial instruments in the Indian stock market.

Objective:
The primary objective of this task is to create a system that continuously retrieves and processes financial data for BankNifty and India VIX, calculates implied volatility for call and put options, and updates this information in an Excel workbook in real-time. The code appears to be part of a financial analysis or trading system.

Key Insights:

Data Retrieval:

The code uses the pymongo library to connect to a MongoDB database for data retrieval.
It also uses the redis library to connect to multiple Redis databases to fetch different types of data, such as index data, options data, and futures data.
Real-time Data:

The code appears to be structured to run continuously in a while loop, suggesting real-time data processing.
It fetches live data for BankNifty and India VIX, which is crucial for making timely financial decisions.
Data Processing:

The code calculates implied volatility for call and put options. Implied volatility is a critical parameter in option pricing and reflects market expectations of future volatility.
The implied volatility calculations are based on the Black-Scholes model, a widely used formula for option pricing.
Excel Workbook Update:

The xlwings library is used to interact with an Excel workbook.
The code updates various sheets and cells within the workbook with live financial data, including index spot prices, futures prices, strike prices, implied volatilities, and more.
Multiple Expiry Dates:

The code handles multiple expiry dates for options, which is common in financial markets.
It distinguishes between the current and far expiry dates and retrieves relevant data accordingly.
India VIX Graph:

The code seems to maintain a list (list_india_vix) of India VIX values to potentially plot a graph or monitor trends in India VIX.
Error Handling:

The code includes some error-handling mechanisms, as it has try and except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
Documentation:

There is some level of documentation through comments that explain the purpose of certain code blocks and variables.
Possible Enhancements:

Provide the definitions of functions such as get_expiry_names, implied_volatility_call, implied_volatility_put, black_scholes_call, and black_scholes_put to get a complete understanding of the code.
Consider adding more extensive comments and documentation to improve code readability and maintainability.
Implement logging to keep track of errors and events during real-time data processing.
Enhance the code's modularity and organization by breaking it into functions and classes for better code structure and maintenance.
Overall, this code appears to be part of a financial analysis or trading system that focuses on real-time data processing and updating an Excel workbook with key financial information related to BankNifty and India VIX.
